##### 1

Silvia Calderoni, the main character, is fascinating. Far from the classic criteria of beauty, very androgynous ; her presence is bewitching.

##### 2

Gus Van Sant manages to film as if we were in a Hitchcock movie: one constantly wonders what will happen next. Also, as stated by a friend, frames and camera movements embrace the characters and the settings with the greatest subtlety.

##### 3

Gucci clothes are completely incredible, in the first sense of the word, i.e. impossible to believe, improbable ; furthermore, models are incredible as well. Bottom line, we are fully immersed in an oneiric world.

##### 4

I am fond as well of how the showing off of clothes and accessories in the movie is shameless, or "spudorato" in Italian, which conveys better the sense of indecency.

##### 5 

Real-life people, i.e. non-models, non-actors, who are invited to every short film are really good. Paul B. Preciado (who I like a lot) is the first to appear and sets the general frame. 

##### 6

Apart from Preciado, I didn't actually know much of the others real-life people, so I went to browse the Gucci site, there is a small insert for each of them, it's very interesting.

##### 7 

I love the soundtrack. Every bit of it.

##### 8 

Guest pop stars. 
Harry Styles in episode 3 (haver a look at teens on Tik Tok filming themselves while watching the episode - mise en abyme), 
Billie Eilish in episode 5;
pretty amazing to succeed in mixing Eilish, Berlioz, Styles and Ravel in a coherent thing.

##### 9 

The settings, the interiors are magnificent.

##### 10 

The tension of the main character is counterbalanced by the kindness, simplicity and benevolence of all the other characters. 
In this despicable world à la TPMP, Salvini, AfD or other Trumps, it procures me a prodigious sense of relief.

##### 11

I suspect the the movies are riddled with educated quotes for cinephiles. 
In the first episode, Austine Osayi Osawe Turay cycling round and round irresistibly reminds me of Godard's "Le Mépris", where most of the film consists of Bardot et Piccoli spinning around.
