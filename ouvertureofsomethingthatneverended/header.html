                “In this <a href="https://youtu.be/zKqbG6TLYnc">first episode</a> of the seven-part film collaboration between award-winning director Gus Van Sant (Drugstore Cowboy, My Own Private Idaho, Elephant) and Gucci creative
                director Alessandro Michele, we follow main character Silvia through her eccentric morning routine at home in Rome, including a scene where she throws a dress—from Alessandro
                Michele's first Gucci women's show Fall Winter 2015—off her balcony, to a song by Billie Eilish. Silvia is seen sifting through her post, which reveal colorful Gucci show
                invitations, as well as a mysterious flyer, and then she becomes lost in a television lecture performed by writer and philosopher Paul B. Preciado, until the arrival of an
                unexpected visitor, while a band in another room rehearses a piece of music.”
